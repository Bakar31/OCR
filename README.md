## Comparison among different OCR libraries

OCR is the abbreviation for Optical character recognition or optical character reader. Here I have implemented some of the best available OCR python libraries on test images. Those image are not well taken as the main goal is to test the performance on the real world noisy dataset.

## Result
 - Pytesseract performed very poorly. Despite some preprocessing, accuracy remained unchanged..
 - In terms of detection, both EasyOCR and PaddleOCR performed admirably. But the drawing was poor for PaddleOCR.
 - *`EasyOCR was the best performer`* in all section.
